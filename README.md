## PREFACE

As quantum computing continues to advance, it poses a growing threat to the security of blockchain technology. The use of classical cryptographic algorithms in blockchain technology could be easily compromised by quantum computers, making the blockchain vulnerable to attack. As a result, there is a need to develop new cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum computing and can be used to secure the blockchain in a post-quantum world.
AKX Ecosystem aims to build a post-quantum blockchain architecture that is resistant to government control or manipulation, potentially eliminating censorship and enabling secure communication and data exchange. However, this ambitious goal will start with integrating AKXID as an additional protection layer over existing mainstream blockchains. This approach will enable protection of existing assets and real-life items from theft while paving the way for a more secure, decentralized future.
Post-quantum cryptography is critical to ensuring data privacy and security on any online platform, and AKX Ecosystem's blockchain architecture provides users with confidence that their data and
